My name is Brian Smith, and I am a computer enthusiast. I have been learning and practicing 
software design for 5 years, primarily in Java. Though Java is my most familiar language, Python is my favorite.
I am currently working on a project in Python to solve Wordle. <br><br>

Looking for a Summer 2022 internship.<br><br>
